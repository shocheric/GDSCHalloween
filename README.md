# First GDSC Halloween Web Design Competition


Happy Halloween GDSC! Today, you are going to be a part of the first GDSC Halloween Web Design Contest. In the files provided to you, you have an index.html file and a styles.css file. These are the standard naming conventions used for such files. In these files are the building blocks for your very own website, but you've only been provided the template, and it is up to you to complete it using HTML and CSS, two web design languages that work hand-in-hand to style and template everything on the internet. 

Your task is to use the tools given to you to build a webpage of your own creation. Feel free to use other assets and methods not provided or shown to you. In fact, its encouraged!

## Getting Started
To clone the repository from github to your local machines, run the terminal command:
    git clone https://github.com/shocheric/GDSCHalloween.git

To get your webpage to display in your browser, double click on your index.html file and click "copy path", then paste it into your address bar.


### HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to outline your websites and add the components that you want to have. Think of it as the skeleton of the website. Alone, it looks plain and has limited functionality, but it is the core of the website. Everything fancy comes after. If you want to see what an HTML only website looks like, check out https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/. Not too pretty.


### CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a file that tells your HTML how to appear and organize itself. With CSS you can add color, change fonts, add hover and click animations for your buttons, align your website components, and so much more. This is the language that brings personality to your website, and it is a fundamental tool in web programming.

### (Bonus) Javascript
We will not be learning JavaScript yet, but we will soon in the future. JavaScript is what brings your website to life. With it you can add page redirection, events on button clicks, send data to the backend, populate tables and other content on the website, and much more. Stay tuned.

### Defining CSS styles
Remember, use #example selector for referencing id's, .example for referencing classes, and example for html components (no special character needed). 

Syntax example:

.heading {
    font-size: 20px;
    color: black;
}
